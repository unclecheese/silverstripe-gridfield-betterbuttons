Better Buttons for GridField
====================================

Modifies the detail form of GridFields to use more user-friendly actions, including:

* **Save and add another**: Create a record, and go right to adding another one, without having to click the back button, and then add again.
* **Save and close**: Save the record and go back to list view
* **User-friendly delete**: Extracted from the tray of constructive actions and moved away so is less likely to be clicked accidentally. Includes inline confirmation of action instead of browser alert box.
* **Cancel**: Same as the back button, but in a more convenient location
* **Previous/Next record**: Navigate to the previous or next record in the list without returning to list view


## Requirements
SilverStripe 3.0 or higher
